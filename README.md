# BubbleSort
VS integration with GitHub

# This is the bubble-sort algorithm which is the slowest algorithm for sorting. It's easy
# to implement when the dataset is small. The outer loop represents the number of swaps that
# are done for comparison of data. The inner loop is actually used to do the comparison of data.
# At the end of each inner loop iteration, the largest value is moved to the end of the array.
# In the first iteration that will be the overall largest value, in the second iteration the second
# largest value, etc etc.
# More() function is used for comparison which means when the value of the first argument is greater
# than the value of the second argument then perform a swap. By this, elements are sorted in ascending
# order. Use a Less() function to sort in descending order. 
# Time complexity is O(n^2) */
